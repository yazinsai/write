# How we successfully achieved human cloning using oDesk.

"We don't have time".

There's always a ton of things that need doing at a startup, especially if you're starting up solo. One of the ways that I've been able to get more done in less time is using oDesk.

## Isn't oDesk where you get cheap labor?

It's surprising to me how so many people think that! That's perhaps one of the biggest misconceptions about online work. Many people have a mental image of a freelancer as an underpaid worker from Asia that develops cheap websites for $5/hour.

Spend any meaningful time on the site however, and you'll realize that that's simply not true. I've worked with amazing people on oDesk -- some have PhDs, some work for awesome companies like Google and Facebook.

Just keep in mind that it can get expensive. The best people don't come cheap, and I've paid $60+/hour for help from experienced professionals. Though rare, I've seen people on there that charge $100+/hour.

## When to oDesk, and when not to.

Startups are well known for being insanely hectic. In fact, if your startup doesn't feel like a constant firedrill, then I would question your commitment. Running a startup is like having a baby that's puking, drooling and pooping all at the same time. With just two hands (one of which is carrying the leaking baby) you're going to need to prioritize which leak gets your attention.

There's only so much you can do in a day. At some point you're going to need to get help, and outsourcing is a great place to start .. especially if the help you need is temporary and requires specific domain knowledge that you don't have.

### Ok, but how do I know *what* to outsource?

Great question, and it's pretty darn important. The answer is the one everyone hates to hear: it depends. Fear not though, I'll go through the main factors you'll need to consider in order to reach to an answer that fits your business:

#### 1. Only outsource things that can be broken down into small bits

If you're building a shuttle to take you to space, don't outsource the fuselage. Start with the tail section, or some other self-contained piece (If you're *really* building a space shuttle, please don't take this advice at face value and seek a professionals opinion).

To take an example that's more down to Earth (see what I did there?), check out **some of the things we've outsourced here at White**:
- The API Wrapper libraries for the different languages (PHP, Ruby, Java, Objective C)
- Integrations with 3rd party platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce)

#### 2. Never outsource this
Your core competency. 

It probably wouldn't be a great idea if we went and outsourced the payment processing engine (the brain that powers White) to a 3rd party. Your core competency often needs to evolve .. based on customer feedback and your learning. Never outsource your core competency.

I think support is another big one. If you want to provide amazing - truly amazing - customer support, you need to keep it in-house. 

> Never outsource anything that has the word "customer" in it.

#### Repetitive tasks are great for outsourcing

Remember, once you find a great person or two - you can come back to that person in the future and use them again .. thereby greatly reducing the learning time. As a bonus, you get someone you've worked with before - and who gets how you work.

You want to outsource tasks that are important, but can also be broken down into small bits.

#### What's your hourly rate?

Establish an hourly rate -- if whatever you're doing is cheaper to outsource than it is to do yourself (and it almost always is), then you can consider outsourcing it. My hourly rate to be $80/hr.. and it's essentially the rate someone has paid you in the past (and not some random number that corresponds to the size of your ego).

#### Outsource 

When you look at all the things that you need to do, it's always good to separate the core items - things that you absolutely *must* do yourself - from secondary ones (things that anyone can do).

For example, when starting White .. I found that I would need to spend a significant amount of time developing API wrappers for the many different programming languages out there. While this was something I *could* do myself, it would require learning a bunch of new programming languages just to write the wrappers. Not very efficient. I was able to find people on oDesk to help with the development of these wrappers, people that are much better at it than I could possibly become had I attempted to do it quickly.

In your case, it might be a landing page design, or a newsletter design .. or perhaps copywriting. There's only so much we can do, and there are so many things that we're just not good at. Before diving into a new topic and attempting to learn it .. ask yourself: can I get someone else do this for me without me having to do it myself?s

## How we use oDesk at White

1. Hired a Russian hacker to attempt to penetrate our systems. It's better to proactively get hacked, by someone you're paying, than to risk someone else doing it. You can find an exotic mix of great penetration testing experts on oDesk, many of which have discovered fixes in companies like Facebook, Google, AirBnB, major banks and other institutions way bigger than ours.
2. 

Remember:
- Before outsourcing, sign the legal docs
- Break down into small project, and send hire multiple people to test it (Sivers) -- it's alot easier to make relative comparisons than absolute pass/fail ones.
- Add a line that says include the word "penguin" in the top of your response for consideration (Anywherist)
- Be clear about deliverables and timeline up front (it's delegation after all)
- Avoid fixed-price projects (it shows lack of trust)
- Know how to verify the work.
- Ask good resources for references (e.g. Sebastian --> friend)
